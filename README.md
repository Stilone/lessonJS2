## Background

This project has been an essential part of my learning journey, providing me with hands-on experience in working with Git and version control. While it may not be my first project, it holds significant value to me as it represents my early progress as a developer.

During the development process, I made a conscious decision not to modify the existing code. I wanted to preserve the project in its initial state as a reminder of my growth. This presented challenges, but I embraced them and pushed myself to move forward.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the online community for their unwavering support and guidance throughout my learning process. Various video tutorials, forums, and online resources have played a pivotal role in shaping my understanding of web development.

## Conclusion

Although this project may appear simple, it holds immense significance as a milestone in my coding journey. It reminds me of the excitement and difficulties I encountered as a beginner. It stands as a testament to my determination to continually improve and evolve as a developer.
