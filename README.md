**Welcome** üëã to my first project on GitHub! This project serves as my practice in working with Git, although it is not the first project I have worked on. Primarily, I learned from video tutorials and followed along with the instructor, particularly in the `index.html` and `main.js` files. At that time, I used the `lesson1.html` file as a means to practice working with functions and memorizing code through practical application.

I made an effort not to modify the existing code in the project, as I wanted to preserve the initial stage and how everything looked as a memory of my progress. It was challenging for me, but I persevered and continued moving forward.

**Below is a screenshot of the project:**

The project features a shopping cart button and multiple cards displaying images of cat eyes, along with the names and prices of various iPhones. There is also an "Add" button, although the functionality is not yet implemented as I was still in the learning phase at that time.

  Additionally, I would like to express my gratitude to the online community for their guidance and support throughout this learning journey. The knowledge I gained from tutorials, forums, and online resources played a significant role in shaping my understanding of web development.

  While this project may seem simple, it represents an important milestone in my coding experience. It reminds me of the excitement and challenges I faced as a beginner, and serves as a testament to my determination to improve and grow as a developer.


Thank you for taking the time to visit this repository and for your interest in my learning process. I hope you find value in this project, and that it inspires others who are just starting their coding journey. üåü

üçÄ Happy coding! üíª
